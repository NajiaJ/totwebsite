# Tears of Themis Website

This website was designed to replicate the homepage and profile page of the original Tears of Themis game.

## Case Study:

- Many otome/games oriented for the women demographic are now using horizontal screens
    - Follows the trend of many other games

- This plans to solve also the problem of card arts not being displayed properly
- ToT has many many beautiful arts so why not display them?
    - In ToTâ€™s official discord, a user commented that this was a great way to see the card arts since it was always a in a limited format

## Technologies Used:
- Git/Github (Version Control)
- VSCode
- Figma (UI Mockups)
    - Insert link to mockup

## License & Others

I do not own any of the artworks used here in the website, they all belong to Tears of Themis and Hoyoverse
